This directory contains scripts to assist in cross compiling charm for android.

First, create an empty directory to work in. This will be refered to as $BD.
This directory will be refered to as $SCRIPTS
Into this directory, download and decrompress charm and its dependencies. The folder should contain the following subdirectories

android-ndk-r8e
android-sdk-linux
android-python27
gmp
pbc
charm
python-lib (from the PY4A project)

At the beggining of each script is a definition for the $BD variable. Either set these to the path of the directory you just created, or set BD to said directory in your shell

To build the dependencies:
cd $BD/android-python27 && $SCRIPTS/python.sh
cd $BD/gmp && $SCRIPTS/gmp.sh
cd $BD/pbc && $SCRIPTS/pbc.sh
cd $BD/charm && $SCRIPTS/charm.sh

Finnally, to package charm into a zip, run:
cd $BD && $SCRIPTS/collect.sh

This will create a file at $BD/out/python_27.zip. This zip contains the cross compile python, charm, and dependencies.

-- each line with at least one pairing contains only pairings, no other calculations

-- last line of decrypt is assignment of message itself, and the calculation can only be an operation
on at most two variables

-- in Decrypt, for loops must run from 0 to their length, NOT entries in a different dictionary.  If the
keys must be entries in a different dictionary, the first statement of the for loop can contain that
assignment.
